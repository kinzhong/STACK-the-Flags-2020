DESCRIPTION
Apparently, the lead engineer left the company (“Safe Online Technologies”). He was a talented engineer and worked on many projects relating to Smart City. He goes by the handle c0v1d-agent-1. Everyone didn't know what this meant until COViD struck us by surprise. We received a tip-off from his colleagues that he has been using vulnerable code segments in one of a project he was working on! Can you take a look at his latest work and determine the impact of his actions! Let us know if such an application can be exploited!
