DESCRIPTION
We’ve intercepted this transmission between Oswell and COViD. It looks like a small program that allows them to communicate secretly with a key known only to them. Unfortunately the program that we have is lacking the key. It is likely that this program can be Tried Online with an Interpreter with a language that has been Extended.

We have some ideas on how to find the key. It is known that Oswell has a bad memory, so it is likely that the key is available somewhere. It may also be possible to brute force the key instead.
